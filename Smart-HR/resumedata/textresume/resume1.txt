I am  Major Projects     Improving Performance with MKL in SVMs  Dr. Manik Varma, MSR India Dr. Prateek Jain, MSR India May 2010 - Present Summer Internship and B.Tech Project Support Vector Machines learn linear classi ers from labelled training data to predict labels for previ- ously unseen test data. Kernels with SVM s allow to learn non linear classi ers, and hence lead to much higher classi cation accuracies in practice. We are learning non linear kernel combinations to give us even better classi cation accuracies and are seeing a possibility of a signi cant performance increase. Also, looking at new regularizers (which take into account the model complexity) for use in the MKL objective. Working towards submitting this to one of ICML, NIPS or ECCV.    Unsupervised Video Surveillance  Prof. Subhashis Banerjee, CSE, IITD Student Undergraduate Research Award (SURA - 2009) May 2009 - October 2009 This project involved the development of a novel technique to detect unusual activities in videos in an unsupervised manner. We used pLSA with an appropriate choice for features on video clips to obtain clustering of similar videos, and any new activity di erent from the ones learnt was  agged as unusual. We also extended the idea to multi person unusual activity detection.  Other Projects   Captcha Reader  Prof. Prem Kalra Digital Image Analysis Course Project November 2010 I made a simple captcha reader to read the captcha in use for the institute web mail. It involved letter segmentation and training in a semi supervised manner using a KNN classi er.    Using Structural Information for Object Recognition  Prof. Subhashis Banerjee Computer Vision Course Project April 2010 I investigated various feature vectors and techniques and frameworks for incorporating structural infor- mation in object recognition tasks.   Non Photo-realistic Rendering  Prof. Prem Kalra Digital Image Analysis Course Project September 2010 Implemented color quantization, dithering, image segmentation and edge enhancement (by edge linking, di erential thickening and smoothing) to give a painterly look to photo-realistic images.    Knowledge Management  Prof. Subhashis Banerjee Independent Project January 2010 - October 2010 Conceptualized new web 2.0 based IT services such as Interest Group Discussion Forums, Campus  Wiki, Project Database to allow easier collaboration, better information organization and formalizing undocumented technical know how. Designed intuitive user interfaces and work- ows for these services and customized existing open source drupal and foswiki project (by adding kerberos authentication, LDAP integration), to  nally deploy these services in the institute.    Funny Cell  Assistant Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth March 2010 - April 2010 Computer Networks Course Project This project was based on a molecule based inter-cell communication simulator designed by our professor. We designed and analyzed robust communication protocols for inter cell molecular communication among antibody cells in a loss full unreliable medium. Also designed combat strategies against infection cells.  Scholastic Achievements   Institute Rank 1: Consistently maintaining institute rank 1 among 450 students over the last 3 years  at IIT Delhi.
